                                    Before The Monarchy
                                </h5>
                                <p>
                                    Available information about this period has been quite sketchy and derived mainly from oral tradition that has existed since before records. What has been established, however, is that some people groups of Yoruba, Nupe and Igala origins came at different times and were the core groups that constituted the Itsekiri nation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Research still has to be done to provide more information in this area. This is more so when we consider that the Ebu people in Delta North of Nigeria have words and language formations similar to those of the Itsekiri language. Likewise, the Oworo people of Kogi State in the North of Nigeria also have a similar linguistic affinity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    These are no neighbours at all but are far removed from one another and with several other and very different ethnic nationalities between them and us. It cannot be said that such traces of linguistic affinity was derived from proximity or other forms of contact and interaction over an extended period for that to have been developed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is instructive to note that such linguistic affinity does not exist between Edo and Itsekiri even though the Edo group, which was the last of the people group, came and joined us since from over five centuries ago. This means that by the time they arrived that long ago, the Itsekiri language had been set and was well established already. The only traces of Edo in the Itsekiri language are in royal and chieftaincy matters and references. This is understandable because those institutions came from the Benin Kingdom.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One thing that can be firmly stated is that by the fifteenth century, the core of the Itsekiri nation had been established. It was only to be affected by the factors of growth dynamics.

                                    The Monarchy
                                </h5>
                                <p>
                                    The monarchical era covered from 1480 to 1848 AD, about 360 years of an uninterrupted period when kings ruled the kingdom. Sixteen (16 kings) Olus reigned in succession during this period.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As this era progressed, so did the Iwere Kingdom grow in the development of our governance, world view, socio-cultural values and practices and religion. The result was greatly enhanced through our early contact with Europeans, some of whom lived among us as Industrialists and international businessmen. For instance, the place called JAMANI (our name for Germany), which is very close to the mouth of the OLERO River in Warri North Local Government Area, got that name from being an Industrial Base of some German industrialists who had settled there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This was when Christian missionaries came, most from Portugal and lived among us at the request of the Olu of Iwere (as the Olu of Warri was then known) who did so in a letter to the Pope. This was also when we subsequently had the then Crown Prince, who went at his father’s instance to Portugal for his University education and as a guest of the Royal Court of Portugal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He was the one who gave the commission for the Warri Monarch’s Crown to be made with the Cross of Jesus Christ at its top to signify that his kingdom (The Iwere Kingdom as it was then known) was under the Lordship of Jesus Christ. His Majesty Atuwatse, brought materials of the Order of Christ which have since been part of the regalia of the Olu of Warri. These were made and have been in use for over 350 years. The concept and the mode of the regalia of the Chiefs of Warri Kingdom were also derived from this source.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is a sense in which it could be rightly said that this era was like the golden age for us as a people. This is because we were on our own, under our king and followed our system of governance. We related with others as equals, whether they be Europeans or fellow Africans. We enslaved others who had a good measure of life, making them proud to be part of us. Our territory was intact. No people invaded us to take our land, nor did we fight any expansionist war to take other people’s land.

                                </h5>
                                <p>
                                    This is a period of eighty-eight (88) years which began in 1848 AD after the demise of Olu Akengbuwa. All attempts to have a succeeding Olu failed, one after the other. We then had Governors who were appointed. We had four of them in succession, which began with Diare, an Omajaja. He was succeeded by Tsaninomi (also spelt Chaninomi), an Otonolu, who succeeded Olomu, another Omajaja. Finally, he was succeeded by Nanna (real name is EREOMALA which was corrupted by Europeans to Nanna), who was one of his sons.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Governors knew they were appointed to govern in trust for the kingdom on behalf of the Olu and conducted themselves as such. Among other duties, they collected customs and additional revenues from foreigners who came on business and handled all external affairs on behalf of the throne. Moreover, they knew they would cease functioning as soon as an Olu was crowned. Therefore, they were also accountable in that regard.

                                <p>
                                    During the time of Nanna (Ereomala) as Governor, the war with the British Colonialists broke out in 1894 A D. The battle was fierce, and the British could not make any headway despite their superior firepower. However, through the betrayal of Nanna by someone who gave some vital intelligence information to the British, they adjusted their tactics and were then enabled to start gaining the upper hand against him. He was quick to rightly read the decisive turn of the tide against him and left through the creeks and some canals he had his men dug so that he could divert his movement from some parts of the existing waterways he wanted to avoid for strategic reasons.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He finally arrived in Lagos, where he first met his friend, Akitoye, the then Oba of Lagos. After discussing with his friend, he turned himself into the British in Lagos, which was already a British Colony at the time.

                                <p>
                                    Although that war ended the era of the Governors, the interregnum continued. This time, however, Warri Kingdom was fused into what became The Southern Protectorate under colonial Britain. Chief Dure Numa (real name is Omadoghogbone which the British corrupted to Dure) was appointed by the British as a Paramount Chief who ruled under colonial Britain. <br>
                                    Before the war, our relationship with the British was purely on commerce, just like we had with other European groups. But, as it turned out, the British expanded their interests beyond trade to colonization.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On the demise of Dure Numa in 1932, the clamour for the return to our Monarchy finally gained ground and brought the 88 years of the interregnum to its end. By this time, Iwere had since become Warri, and Itsekiri had become Jekri, as the British preferred to call them. Warri was then the Headquarters of Warri Province under the British Colonial Administration.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Although the Monarchy returned in 1936 with the crowning of his Majesty Ginuwa II, it was no longer the same. This was because the Iwere Kingdom was now part of Warri Province over which Chief Dure Numa exercised authority no longer on behalf of the Olu of Iwereland as the four Itsekiri Governors were and did, but now on behalf of the British colonial Crown.

                                <p>
                                    By the time we returned to the Monarchy in 1936 with the crowning of His Majesty Ogiame Ginuwa II, Nigeria had existed as an entity for twenty-two (22) years with the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Protectorates in 1914 which brought this about.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As we became part of Nigeria, we ceased to be entirely on our own, just like the other component ethnic nationalities that constitute the Nigerian nation-state. This is why the return of the Monarchy did not amount to the system we had from the beginning. Instead, our fortunes had become tied to that of the others as well.
